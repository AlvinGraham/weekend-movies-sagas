# Movie List

## Description

_Duration: 2 day Sprint_

This project is a solution to the Prime Digital Academy weekend challenge of the same name. The end product meets all specs for baseline goals. The code challenge instructions are found [here](./INSTRUCTIONS.md).

This project involves a full stack application to display a list of movies and allow access to a dteail page for each movie. This lightweight app accomplishes that.

To complete this project I used the following checklist to break the problem down into steps.
